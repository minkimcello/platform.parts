# ref
- [npm search CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-search)
  - [--long](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-search#long) makes no difference (--json or not)
  - does not have offset or count options
  - does not include npm registry score
- [npm search API](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md#get-v1search)
  - includes score
  - includes flags for offset and size
  - includes total
  - indexing is different from cli so you can offset from cli's default 230 size
